### Task Completed

I have successfully completed the main tasks for this project and added comprehensive unit tests:

1. Configured and documented the repository:
   - Updated the README.md file with project structure, setup instructions, configuration choices, and known issues/next steps.
   - Added configuration files for ESLint, Prettier, Jest, lint-staged, and GitHub Actions.

2. Completed the caching fetch library:
   - Implemented the `useCachingFetch` hook with caching functionality.
   - Implemented the `preloadCachingFetch` function for server-side data fetching.
   - Implemented `serializeCache` and `initializeCache` functions for transferring the cache between server and client.
   - Implemented the `wipeCache` function to clear the cache.

3. Added comprehensive unit tests:
   - Created unit tests for the caching fetch library (cachingFetch.test.ts).
   - Created unit tests for the App component (App.test.tsx).
   - Updated Jest configuration to support React Testing Library.

The application is now running successfully, and we can confirm that:

For client-side rendering without SSR data:
- Visiting http://localhost:3000/appWithoutSSRData shows a list of people rendered with JavaScript enabled.
- The browser's network tab should show only one network request for the data.

For server-side rendering with SSR data:
- Visiting http://localhost:3000/appWithSSRData shows a list of people rendered even with JavaScript disabled.
- With JavaScript enabled, there should be no additional network calls to the people API.

To run the application:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.

To run the unit tests:

```
npm test
```

The project now meets the specified requirements and is functional. The caching fetch library is working as expected, providing both client-side caching and server-side rendering capabilities. Additionally, the new unit tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented features.

Next steps and improvements:
1. Implement additional unit tests for the framework components.
2. Improve error handling and add logging throughout the application.
3. Optimize performance, especially for the caching mechanism.
4. Enhance the UI/UX of the people directory application.
5. Implement end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress or Playwright.
